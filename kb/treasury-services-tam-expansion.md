## Part 1: What Companies Actually Pay for Treasury Software

### Tier 1: Legacy Enterprise TMS ($150K - $500K+/yr)

#### Kyriba
- **Vendr median:** $22,787/yr (based on 6 purchases, range $4.6K - $85.5K)
- **Enterprise reality:** $150K - $300K+/yr for full modules (cash, payments, risk, forecasting)
- **Vendr data caveat:** Skews low because self-service/mid-market buyers. Enterprise deals with full suite + global entities + SWIFT connectivity are 5-10x higher
- **Revenue:** $110M in 2018, targeted $400-500M by 2023. Valued at $1B+ (2019 recap). ~2,000+ enterprise clients
- **Customer profile:** Global 2000, mid-market fast-growth. 98% retention rate. Clients include Amway, EA, Interpublic Group, PulteGroup
- **Pricing model:** Per-module SaaS subscription + per-entity fees + bank connection fees
- **Market position:** ~18% TMS market share. Largest pure-play TMS vendor
- **Implementation:** 6-12 months (GTreasury claims Kyriba has "higher total cost of ownership")
- **Key weakness:** Legacy batch processing, requires SI partners for implementation

#### SAP Treasury & Risk Management
- **Pricing:** Perpetual license model embedded in S/4HANA. Often millions upfront for large deployments + 22% annual maintenance
- **RISE with SAP (Cloud):** Subscription-based, starts ~$100K/yr for treasury module, scales with users
- **Reality:** Companies paying $500K-$2M+ for SAP S/4HANA commonly add treasury as a module. Treasury-specific pricing is buried in broader ERP deal
- **Market position:** ~22% TMS market share (largest overall due to ERP bundling)
- **Customer profile:** Already-SAP enterprises. Rarely greenfield treasury choice
- **Implementation:** 12-24+ months as part of broader SAP implementation

#### FIS (Quantum)
- **Pricing:** Enterprise only, not publicly disclosed. Estimated $200K-$500K+/yr
- **Recently launched Quantum Cloud Edition** with microservices architecture
- **Customer profile:** Large banks, insurance companies, public sector, Fortune 500
- **Market position:** One of the "big four" TMS providers per Deloitte
- **Implementation:** 6-18 months

#### ION Group (Wallstreet Suite, IT2, Reval)
- **Pricing:** Not publicly disclosed. Acquired multiple TMS platforms. Enterprise pricing $200K-$600K+/yr estimated
- **Customer profile:** Complex multi-entity treasuries, capital markets-adjacent
- **Market position:** One of the "big four" TMS providers per Deloitte
- **Pricing model:** Varies by acquired product line. Legacy on-prem + cloud migration underway

### Tier 2: Modern Cloud TMS ($24K - $150K/yr)

#### GTreasury
- **Pricing:** Not publicly listed. Capterra/TrustRadius say "contact for pricing"
- **Estimated range:** $50K - $150K/yr based on positioning vs. Kyriba
- **Key differentiator:** Claims 90-day implementation vs Kyriba's 6-12 months
- **Market position:** "AI-amplified" TMS. Acquired CashAnalytics (forecasting) and Visual Risk (derivatives)
- **Messaging against Kyriba:** "Higher total cost of ownership" and "lags on intelligent automation"
- **Customer profile:** Mid-market to enterprise

#### Trovata
- **Base package:** $24,000/yr (publicly listed on website)
- **Includes:** 1 bank, 100 accounts, 1M transactions, 10 users
- **Startup tier:** $250/mo ($3K/yr) - basic
- **Add-ons:** Additional banks, accounts, transactions, users priced separately
- **TMS tier:** Recently launched full TMS capability, pricing not disclosed (likely $50K-$100K+/yr)
- **Key data point:** G2 review claims "reduced treasury management costs by about 77%" switching to Trovata
- **Customer profile:** API-first, cloud-native. Appeals to tech companies and modern finance teams
- **Implementation:** Weeks, not months (their claim)

#### HighRadius (Treasury & Risk)
- **Vendr median:** $12,973/yr (based on 3 purchases, range $12.2K - $16.9K)
- **Reality:** HighRadius is primarily AR/AP automation. Treasury module is newer/smaller
- **Broader platform:** Full HighRadius deals (AR+AP+Treasury) likely $50K-$200K+/yr
- **Key offering:** AI-powered cash forecasting, Rivana digital assistant
- **Customer profile:** Mid-market, companies already using HighRadius for AR/AP

#### Coupa Treasury (formerly Bellin tm5)
- **Pricing:** ITQlick estimates $500-$18,000/user/yr depending on org size
- **Small business (1-10 users):** $50/user/month ($600/yr per user)
- **Enterprise:** Custom pricing, likely $75K-$200K/yr for full suite
- **Customer profile:** Companies already in Coupa ecosystem (BSM, procurement)

### Tier 3: Modern/Startup Treasury ($0 - $24K/yr)

#### Atlar
- **4 tiers:** Connect, Essential, Professional, Enterprise (no public prices)
- **Estimated:** Essential ~$12K-$24K/yr, Professional ~$30K-$60K/yr, Enterprise custom
- **G2 ranking:** #1 in TMS category (Spring 2025)
- **Key differentiator:** API-first, real-time bank connectivity, EU-focused
- **Implementation:** Self-managed (Connect/Essential) or Atlar-led (Professional+)
- **Customer profile:** Scaling companies, EU-headquartered

#### Rho Treasury
- **Pricing:** Free with Rho banking platform (monetizes via banking/card revenue)
- **Treasury yield:** 3.88% on idle cash (registered investment advisor)
- **Customer profile:** Startups and scale-ups already using Rho for banking
- **Limitation:** Treasury is a feature, not a standalone product

#### Modern Treasury
- **Pricing:** Usage-based, annual terms, custom quotes
- **Not a traditional TMS** - payment operations API platform
- **Claim:** $400B+ in payments processed
- **Customer profile:** Developers building payment products (different market than corporate treasury)
- **Recently added:** Stablecoin support, PSP integrations

## Part 7: The Industry Economics

### Software Vendor Margins

| Vendor Type | Gross Margin | Why |
|-------------|-------------|-----|
| Legacy TMS (Kyriba, FIS) | 70-80% | Pure SaaS, but heavy R&D + support |
| Modern TMS (Trovata, Atlar) | 75-85% | Cloud-native, lower support burden |
| ERP-bundled (SAP) | 85-90% | Treasury is incremental margin on existing ERP |
| **TreasuryPath (target)** | **80-88%** | AI-native, no SI dependency, replaces consulting |

### Consulting Firm Margins

| Provider Type | Gross Margin | Why |
|--------------|-------------|-----|
| Big Four treasury | 30-40% | Senior talent + utilization pressure |
| Boutique treasury | 40-55% | Smaller overhead, niche expertise |
| SI implementation | 25-35% | Project-based, competitive bidding |

### The Margin Arbitrage Opportunity

TreasuryPath captures consulting-type revenue at software margins:

```
Consulting revenue TreasuryPath displaces:     $50K-$200K per customer per year
Cost to deliver (AI agents):                    ~$2K-$5K per customer per year (compute + data)
Incremental margin on displaced consulting:     95%+
Blended gross margin (software + AI advisory):  80-88%
```

This is the whole play. You're converting 35% margin consulting revenue into 85%+ margin software revenue. At scale, this is the margin expansion story investors pay premium multiples for.

### Revenue Per Customer Comparison

| Vendor | Est. ARPC (Avg Revenue Per Customer) | Customers | Est. Revenue |
|--------|-------------------------------------|-----------|-------------|
| Kyriba | $120K-$180K | 2,000+ | $240M-$360M (est. 2025) |
| Trovata | $30K-$50K | ~500 (est.) | $15M-$25M (est.) |
| Atlar | $25K-$40K | ~200 (est.) | $5M-$8M (est.) |
| GTreasury | $80K-$120K | ~800 (est.) | $64M-$96M (est.) |
| **TreasuryPath (target)** | **$80K-$120K** | **Year 1: 10-20** | **$800K-$2.4M** |

TreasuryPath ARPC target is higher than modern TMS vendors because we're capturing the consulting dollar too.

## Part 8: The Investor Pitch

### The Killer Slide

─────────                                ────────────
Kyriba license:        $200K/yr          Software + AI advisory: $90K/yr
Elire implementation:  $175K (one-time)  AI-guided onboarding:   $0
Deloitte optimization: $75K/yr           AI agents:              $0

Total Year 1:          $450K             Total Year 1:           $90K
Total Year 2+:         $275K/yr          Total Year 2+:          $90K/yr
                                         
Customer saves:        60-80%
Your gross margin:     80-88%
Their margin:          Mixed (70% software + 35% consulting = ~55% blended)
```

### Key Investor Talking Points

1. **$8-13B combined TAM** (not just $6.6B software). We compete for both the software dollar AND the consulting dollar
2. **Margin arbitrage:** Converting 35% margin consulting into 85% margin AI. That's the whole financial thesis
3. **Implementation moat:** Kyriba requires $150K+ consulting to deploy. We deploy in weeks with AI. That's not just faster - it eliminates the biggest customer objection
4. **Higher ARPC than modern TMS:** $80-120K vs $25-50K because we capture the advisory spend too
5. **98% of Kyriba customers renew** - treasury is mission-critical and sticky. Once you're in, you're in
